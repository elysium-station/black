</div>

Reference implementation of Black, a blockchain for cross-chain DeFi. Built using the [cosmos-sdk](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk).

## Mainnet

The current recommended version of the software for mainnet is [v0.23.0](https://github.com/Elysium-Station/black/releases/tag/v0.23.0). The master branch of this repository often contains considerable development work since the last mainnet release and is __not__ runnable on mainnet.

### Installation and Setup
For detailed instructions see [the Black docs](https://docs.black.io/docs/participate/validator-node).

```bash
git checkout v0.23.0
make install
```

End-to-end tests of Black use a tool for generating networks with different configurations: [kvtool](https://github.com/Elysium-Station/kvtool).
This is included as a git submodule at [`tests/e2e/kvtool`](tests/e2e/kvtool/).
When first cloning the repository, if you intend to run the e2e integration tests, you must also
clone the submodules:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Elysium-Station/black.git
```

Or, if you have already cloned the repo: `git submodule update --init`

## Testnet

For further information on joining the testnet, head over to the [testnet repo](https://github.com/Elysium-Station/black-testnets).

## Docs

Black protocol and client documentation can be found in the [Black docs](https://docs.black.io).

If you have technical questions or concerns, ask a developer or community member in the [Black discord](https://discord.com/invite/kQzh3Uv).
